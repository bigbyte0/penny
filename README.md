# Penny
_Your terminal flashcard utility._

__Note: Since Penny isn't currently pacakged as an executable, you have to create a batch or shell script to execute it globally. Otherwise, Penny can be run in Python as long as it is fed global file paths.__

Penny is a free and open source flashcard utility that runs straight in the terminal.

It supports basic flashcards with fronts and backs. Note that Penny does not support any special file or text formats, including markdown and rich text. Penny's goal is to provide the most basic flashcard functionality in the most compact form possible. 

## How to use
### Basic Usage
To run a session that randomly shuffles and exhausts every flashcard in a deck, run:

```
penny <path/to/flashcard/file>
```
